### Data Flow

1. User financial data is collected (with permission) from various sources
2. Data is processed, anonymized, and stored on the blockchain
3. AI models analyze the data to generate credit scores and risk assessments
4. Users can view their scores and control access to their data
5. Lenders can request access to scores for lending decisions

### AI Models

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural networks for credit scoring
- **Natural Language Processing**: Sentiment analysis of financial communications
- **Time Series Analysis**: Prediction of future financial behavior
- **Quantitative Finance Models**: Risk analysis (Value at Risk, Sharpe Ratio)

## Development Steps

1. **Smart Contract Development**
   - Write and deploy Solidity contracts to handle credit data
   - Implement secure identity management and access control
   - Create on-chain credit score calculation mechanisms
   - Develop oracle integrations for off-chain data

2. **AI Model Training**
   - Train models on financial datasets for credit scoring
   - Implement fraud detection algorithms
   - Develop risk assessment models
   - Create behavioral analysis systems

3. **API Integration**
   - Connect the blockchain and AI models via Node.js APIs
   - Implement secure data exchange protocols
   - Create endpoints for third-party integrations
   - Develop webhook notifications for credit events

4. **Frontend Development**
