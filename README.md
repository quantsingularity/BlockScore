# Decentralized Credit Scoring System

## Overview
The Decentralized Credit Scoring System is a blockchain-powered platform that leverages AI and quantitative finance to assess creditworthiness transparently and fairly. It aims to provide unbiased credit scores, especially for underbanked populations.

> **Note**: BlockScore is currently under active development. Features and functionalities are being added and improved continuously to enhance user experience.

## Features
- Immutable credit transaction records using blockchain.
- AI-powered risk analysis and credit scoring models.
- Quantitative finance models to optimize risk assessment for lenders.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum or Polygon for implementing smart contracts.
- **AI/ML**: Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for predictive credit scoring.
- **Database**: MongoDB for decentralized storage (off-chain).
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API development.
- **Frontend**: React.js for user interfaces.
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity for loan agreements and credit data storage.
- **Quantitative Finance Models**: Risk analysis (Value at Risk, Sharpe Ratio).

## Architecture
1. **Frontend**:
   - Built using React.js to provide a seamless user experience.
2. **Backend**:
   - Node.js API integrates blockchain and ML models for credit scoring.
3. **Blockchain**:
   - Ethereum smart contracts for storing immutable credit history.
4. **AI Models**:
   - Neural networks and regression models to predict credit scores.

## Development Steps
1. **Smart Contract Development**:
   - Write and deploy Solidity contracts to handle credit data.
2. **AI Model Training**:
   - Train models on financial datasets for credit scoring.
3. **API Integration**:
   - Connect the blockchain and AI models via Node.js APIs.
4. **Frontend Development**:
   - Build a React.js app for users to check and manage credit scores.
