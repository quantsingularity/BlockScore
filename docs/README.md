- **usage.md**: Provides detailed instructions on how to use the various features of the BlockScore platform, including step-by-step guides for common workflows. This document serves as a user manual for the platform.

### Supporting Resources

The documentation directory also includes supporting resources:

- **images/**: A subdirectory containing visual assets used throughout the documentation, including screenshots, diagrams, and illustrations that help clarify concepts and procedures. Currently, this directory contains the BlockScore dashboard screenshot.

## Usage Guidelines

The documentation in this directory is designed to be read in a specific order for new users:

1. Start with **getting-started.md** for an introduction to the platform
2. Review **architecture.md** to understand the system design
3. Explore **usage.md** to learn how to use the platform's features
4. Refer to **api-docs.md** and **sample_requests.md** when developing integrations
5. Consult **troubleshooting.md** when encountering issues

For deployment and administration, the **deployment.md** document provides the necessary information.

## Maintenance and Contributions

The documentation is maintained alongside the codebase and should be updated whenever changes are made to the system. When contributing to the documentation:

1. Ensure technical accuracy and clarity
2. Maintain consistent formatting and style
3. Include practical examples where appropriate
